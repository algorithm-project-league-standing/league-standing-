The time complexity and space complexity of the program depend on the size of the input data. 
Here's an analysis of each portion of the code:

1. Reading CSV file: O(E lg V), 
  where E is the number of played matches and V is the number of teams.

2. Initializing data structures: O(V+E) -> from adjlist -> space Complexity, 
  where V is the number of teams and E is the number of played matches.

3. Traversing the graph to calculate standings by round or date: 
  O(V+E), where V is the number of teams and E is the number of played matches.

4. Sorting the teams based on points, goal difference, and goals scored:
   O(V log V), where V is the number of teams.

5. Writing to the output CSV file: O(V), where V is the number of teams.

Therefore, the overall 
time complexity of the program is O(E lg V), and the 
space complexity is O(V+E).
